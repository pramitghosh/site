## Hi!
Hello! Welcome to my homepage. I am a MSc student (MSc Geoinformatics) and Staff ([Spatio-Temporal Modelling Lab](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/stml/index.html)) at the [Institute for Geoinformatics](http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de), [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de). I can be found in Room 132 in the GEO1 building at [Heisenbergstraße 2, 48149 Münster, Germany](https://www.uni-muenster.de/uv/wwuaz/lageplan/en/8391). I can be reached here: [pramitghosh@uni-muenster.de](mailto:pramitghosh@uni-muenster.de)


## What am I up to lately?
I am currently in the 4th and final semester of my program and contributing towards the H2020 funded project [openEO - A Common, Open Source Interface between Earth Observation Data Infrastructures and Front-End Applications](http://openeo.org) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Edzer Pebesma](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/institute/staff/index.php/119/Edzer_Pebesma).

Additionally, I currently tutor a study project "Monitoring Conflict Areas with Satellite Image Time Series" taught by Dr. Christian Knoth and Prof. Dr. Edzer Pebesma. This course is meant for BSc Geoinformatik and MSc Geoinformatics students.

## Summary
Employed as an assistant contributing to the H2020-funded project “openEO”, I am
developing infrastructure to run users’ custom functions in R on Earth observation data in the cloud.
Having contributed to a number of funded projects after my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from
India, I have experience in research in domains spanning geospatial modelling and oceanography. I
am a (co-)author of 3 peer-reviewed articles published in international journals and an Outstanding
Reviewer for Journal of Hydrology with experience in teaching and presenting research at conferences.
